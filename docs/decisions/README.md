# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Purpose

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture significant architectural,
process, or scope-related decisions made during the project.

They exist to provide long-term traceability and context for decisions
that affect future work.

---

## When to Use an ADR

An ADR is required when a decision:

- Affects long-term architecture or workflow
- Constrains future design options
- Is costly to reverse
- Introduces a new rule, standard, or baseline

---

## Location and Naming

- Directory: `docs/decisions/`
- File naming: `adr-XXXX-short-title.md`
- `XXXX` is a zero-padded sequence number

---

## Status Values

Each ADR must include one of the following statuses:

- Proposed
- Accepted
- Superseded

ADRs are immutable once Accepted.

---

## Structure

Each ADR must include:

- Title
- Status
- Context
- Decision
- Alternatives Considered
- Consequences
- Related Requirements (if applicable)

---

## Change Process

- Changes to decisions require a new ADR
- Superseding ADRs must reference the prior ADR
- Editorial fixes may be made without changing intent
