# Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

## Purpose of this Document
This document defines the **explicit goals, boundaries, and success criteria for v1** of the product.  
It is intentionally higher-level than a technical specification and focuses on **what v1 must accomplish**, not how it is implemented.

This document complements (but does not replace) the README, which describes the broader vision.

---

## Product Goal (v1)

Deliver a **reliable, simple digital scorecard** for archery that replaces paper scorecards for individual practice or informal shooting sessions.

The v1 product should allow a user to:
- Configure a scoring session that matches their round format
- Enter arrow scores efficiently
- See totals calculated automatically
- Save the session for later reference

---

## Target User (v1)

- Individual archer
- Single device
- No account or identity management
- Uses the app primarily during or immediately after shooting

Multi-user scenarios, coaching workflows, and competition management are explicitly out of scope for v1.

---

## Core Problems v1 Solves

- Manual score calculation is error-prone.
- Paper scorecards are inconvenient to store, review, or compare.
- Existing tools are often over-scoped for casual or practice use.

v1 solves these by focusing on **clarity, correctness, and speed of entry**.

---

## v1 Feature Goals (In Scope)

### 1. Session configuration
A user can create a new scoring session by specifying:
- Number of ends
- Arrows per end
- Maximum arrow value
- Optional session title and notes
- Optional X-count tracking (only when max arrow value is 10)

Each session is configured independently.

---

### 2. Score entry
During a session, the user can:
- Enter individual arrow scores per end
- Progress end by end
- See running totals update immediately

The interface should make it clear:
- Which end is active
- How many arrows remain
- What the current total is

---

### 3. Automatic calculations
The app automatically computes:
- End totals
- Session total
- Maximum possible score
- X count (when enabled)

The user should never need to perform mental arithmetic.

---

### 4. Session completion and saving
- A session can only be saved once **all planned arrows are entered**
- Saved sessions are immutable (read-only)
- Saving represents a completed, historical record

---

### 5. Session review
The user can:
- View a list of saved sessions
- Open a saved session to review scores, totals, and notes

This supports basic reflection and record-keeping.

---

## Explicit Non-Goals (Out of Scope for v1)

v1 will **not** include:
- User accounts or authentication
- Cloud sync or multi-device support
- Editing saved sessions
- Equipment, bow, or arrow setup tracking
- Advanced analytics, charts, or trends
- Competition management or official scoring validation
- Social, sharing, or export features

These may be considered for future versions but must not influence v1 decisions.

---

## Data and Persistence (v1 Constraint)

- All data is stored **locally in the browser**
- Data must persist across page reloads and browser restarts
- No guarantees are made for cross-device or cross-browser availability

This constraint is intentional to keep v1 focused and low-friction.

---

## Quality Bar (v1)

v1 is considered successful if:
1. A user can complete an entire scoring session without confusion.
2. Totals are always correct and update immediately.
3. Saved sessions reliably persist locally.
4. The app works offline once loaded.
5. The product feels faster and simpler than paper scoring.

---

## What This MVP Enables Next

By locking v1 to a digital scorecard only, the product establishes:
- A stable concept of a “session”
- A consistent scoring model
- A foundation for future features (analytics, equipment tracking, export)

Future versions may build on this foundation without revisiting v1 goals.

---

## Summary

**v1 is a focused, single-purpose tool**:  
A digital replacement for a paper archery scorecard, optimized for correctness and ease of use.

Anything that does not directly support that purpose is intentionally deferred.
