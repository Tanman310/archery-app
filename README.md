# Archery App

## Overview

Archery App is an early-stage software project focused on supporting rule-compliant recurve barebow archery. The project is currently in the design and requirements definition phase.

This repository serves as the authoritative source for project documentation, design decisions, and future implementation.

---

## Project Status

- Phase: Early design / planning
- Code: Not yet implemented
- Architecture: Not yet finalized

No programming language, framework, or platform has been selected at this time.

---

## Goals

The high-level goals of the project are:

- Support archery use cases aligned with World Archery barebow rules
- Prioritize correctness, transparency, and traceability of decisions
- Maintain a design-first workflow with clear documentation
- Enable future extensibility without premature architectural lock-in

---

## Non-Goals

The project explicitly does not aim to:

- Provide coaching, training advice, or medical guidance
- Enforce proprietary hardware, vendors, or ecosystems
- Optimize for competitive gaming or simulation realism beyond rule compliance
- Commit early to a specific technology stack

---

## Repository Structure

```
├── docs/ # Project documentation and decision records
├── src/ # Application source code (not yet implemented)
├── tests/ # Test code (not yet implemented)
└── .github/ # Issue and pull request templates
```

Documentation is treated as a first-class artifact and precedes implementation.

---

## Documentation

Key documents are located in the `docs/` directory:

- `overview.md` – Functional scope and project description
- `requirements.md` – Functional and non-functional requirements
- `decisions/` – Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), if adopted

---

## Contribution Model

At this stage, development is exploratory and design-driven.

- Significant changes should be documented before implementation
- Architectural or long-term decisions must be explicitly recorded
- Pull requests should clearly state assumptions and risks

Contribution guidelines may be formalized later as the project matures.
